# Global Trends in Agriculture: Crops and Livestock

## Overview
This project explores global agricultural trends across crops and livestock, using open datasets to visualize long-term production changes, regional variations, and sustainability indicators.  
The goal is to derive data-driven insights that support research in food security, climate resilience, and sustainable development.

## Objectives
- Analyze crop and livestock production trends across countries and decades  
- Identify regions and commodities with notable growth or decline  
- Visualize patterns through maps, charts, and interactive dashboards  
- Contribute to open agricultural intelligence for policy and research communities

## Dataset Sources
This project integrates publicly available datasets from:
- **FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)** – global agriculture production and livestock statistics  
- **World Bank** – agriculture and rural development indicators  
- **UN Comtrade** – international trade data for agricultural goods  
- **OECD and national datasets** – regional agricultural metrics and sustainability indices  

All datasets are cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistent units, time ranges, and country codes.
